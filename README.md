<h2>Conduct a Security Audit, Part 1</h2>
<h4>Welcome to the initial segment of my cybersecurity lab, a comprehensive journey into the intricacies of conducting a security audit. This segment focuses on the crucial early steps of the audit process, encompassing the completion of the compliance checklist and controls assessment.</h4>

<h4>The Compliance Checklist: The compliance checklist is a cornerstone in cybersecurity audits, serving as a reference for industry-standard regulations and practices. It ensures that an organization's systems and policies align with recognized standards, which is critical for data security, risk management, and legal compliance.</h4>

<h4>Controls Assessment: Assessing controls is an integral part of the audit process, as it involves evaluating the effectiveness of security controls implemented within an organization. It aims to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and ensure that security measures are robust and adequately safeguard information assets.</h4>

<h4>Two Accessible Formats: To ensure accessibility, I've provided the lab report in both Microsoft Word and PDF formats. This dual format approach caters to your preferred medium and enhances your experience in understanding these initial audit components.</h4>
